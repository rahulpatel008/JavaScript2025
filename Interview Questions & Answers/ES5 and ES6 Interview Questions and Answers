### 1. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
- **var**: Function-scoped or globally-scoped. Can be re-declared and updated.
- **let**: Block-scoped. Cannot be re-declared within the same scope but can be updated.
- **const**: Block-scoped. Cannot be re-declared or updated, but the contents of objects/arrays can be modified.

### 2. How do ES6 arrow functions differ from ES5 functions?
- Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax and lexically bind the `this` value, meaning they inherit `this` from the parent scope.

### 3. What are template literals in ES6 and how do they work?
- Template literals are enclosed by backticks (\`) and allow for embedded expressions using `${expression}`. They support multi-line strings and string interpolation.

### 4. Explain destructuring assignment in ES6.
- Destructuring assignment allows for extracting values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  const [a, b] = [1, 2];
  const { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 25 };
